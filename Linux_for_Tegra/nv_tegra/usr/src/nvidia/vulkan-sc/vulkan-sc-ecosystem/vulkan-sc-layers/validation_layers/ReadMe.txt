The Vulkan SC Validation Layers are provided in this Drive OS SDK package
as a prebuilt binary as a convenience until changes adapting the standard
Vulkan Validation Layers for Vulkan SC are finalized and upstreamed to
public Khronos repositories.

The source used to build the layers is also provided if there is a
desire to build them from scratch. The source can be found in
validation_layers_source.tar.gz and can be unzipped using:

tar -xf validation_layers_source.tar.gz

The Vulkan SC Validation Layers at present do not contain the same level of
support as the standard Vulkan Validation Layers and currently only
provide parameter validation.
