The Vulkan SC Loader is provided in this Drive OS SDK package as a
prebuilt binary as a convenience until changes adapting the standard
Vulkan Loader for Vulkan SC are finalized and upstreamed to public
Khronos repositories.

The source used to build the Loader is also provided if there is a
desire to build it from scratch. The source can be found in
loader_source.tar.gz and can be unzipped using:

tar -xf loader_source.tar.gz
